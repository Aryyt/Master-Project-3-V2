1. run the files inside the '1-get_soilgrids_and_combine' folder to get the SoilGrids and Agri4cast data combined
2. run the 3 jupyter notebooks in the root (labled with 1,2,3) in their order (Note: you will need to downlad the CY-Bench data since it is too big for us to provide it to you)
but this github has the yield data already precomputed so you can skip it and run the other ones
3. use the datasets to run the models provided in their respective folders
